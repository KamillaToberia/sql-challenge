# SQL CHALLENGE

  For this project, I'll deign the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into SQL database, and then answer questions about the data.
  This project will have three parts:
  - Data modeling,
  - Data engineering, and data analysis.
    
## DATA MODELING

  Inspect the CSV files, and then sketch an Entity Relationship of the tables.
  - Make the diagram using Quick DBD
